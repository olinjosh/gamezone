<p >Poki SDK Implementation Guide
Welcome to the Poki SDK Implementation Guide!

The Poki SDK makes it possible to serve advertisements in the game and allows us to track key in-game metrics (e.g. time spent loading the game). We've created our SDK to be lightweight and easy to implement.

Key information
Before you get started we would like you to read some key items about the implementation that holds for all engines:

Make sure that all outgoing links and branding/advertisements (e.g. splash-screens, social links and app-store links) are removed from the game.

Implement keyboard-controls whenever possible, e.g. in menu navigation and in-game. 
Most of our users are playing on laptops, so often they will only have a trackpad available. Using keyboard-controls will make your game more accessible.

Make sure your game is fit for a scalable 16:9 ratio and remove full-screen functionality.
If your game is an explicit portrait-mode game, see if you can add functionality to the sidebars, e.g. showing unlocked characters. Check this. Full-screen is available from our platform side.

After implementing the SDK, upload your game to Poki for Developers and test it in our QA tool. Once you're happy with the implementation (or if you're stuck on something), send us a message and we'll review. Get in touch with your Poki contact if you do not yet have a Poki for Developers account.

Please be aware that the above is mandatory.</p>
